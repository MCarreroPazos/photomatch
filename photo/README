------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photo is an image viewer with a simple and fast interface, being good looking and highly configureable.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
Qt 4


INSTALL
-------
1) qmake
2) make

3) (as root) make install  -> that simply moves the executeable (per default) to /usr/bin/.
				Right now, the only way to change that is to edit the file
				photo.pro (before running step 1) and adjust the "target.path"
				variable.
				Or you can simply move the binary file manually to whereever you want.
